# 📄 PDF Chatbot with Groq (RAG Application)

This project is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot** that allows users to **upload a PDF document** and interact with it by asking questions. It processes the PDF, extracts meaningful text, converts it into **embeddings using Hugging Face**, stores it in a **FAISS vector database**, and retrieves relevant context to generate responses using **Groq’s LLM**.

---

## 🚀 Use Case  

Imagine you have a **50-page research paper** or **legal document** and need quick insights. Instead of manually reading it, this chatbot lets you **ask specific questions** and get AI-powered answers instantly!

---

## 📌 Features  

✅ **Upload a PDF** – Extracts and processes text automatically.  
✅ **Ask questions** – Interact with the document like a chatbot.  
✅ **Fast and efficient search** – Uses **FAISS** for optimized vector search.  
✅ **Context-aware answers** – Generates responses based on relevant sections.  
✅ **Simple and user-friendly UI** – Built with **Streamlit**.  
✅ **Secure API integration** – Uses **Groq’s AI model** for response generation.

## 🏗️ Project Workflow  

### 1️⃣ PDF Upload & Processing  
- The user **uploads a PDF file** via the Streamlit UI.  
- The **PyPDF2** library extracts text from the document.  
- The extracted text is **split into smaller chunks** for better processing.  

### 2️⃣ Creating Embeddings & Storing in FAISS  
- **Hugging Face embeddings** are generated for each text chunk.  
- These embeddings are stored in a **FAISS vector store** for fast retrieval.  

### 3️⃣ Answer Generation with Groq  
- When a user asks a question, the **vector store searches** for relevant chunks.  
- The **retrieved text** is passed to **Groq’s LLM** to generate an answer.  
- The answer is displayed in the chat interface.

## 🛠️ Installation Guide  

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pdf-chatbot.git
cd pdf-chatbot
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Set Up API Keys  
Create a `secrets.toml` file in your Streamlit folder and add your **Groq API key**:

## 📌 How It Works (With Examples)  

### **Step 1: Upload a PDF**  
- You upload a PDF file (e.g., **"Data Science Research.pdf"**).  

### **Step 2: Ask a Question**  
Example:  
**User:** *"What are the key findings of the research?"*  
**Chatbot:** *"The research highlights that deep learning models outperform traditional machine learning methods in image recognition tasks, achieving a 95% accuracy rate..."*  

### **Step 3: Get AI-Powered Answers**  
- The chatbot retrieves relevant sections from the PDF and generates an answer.
